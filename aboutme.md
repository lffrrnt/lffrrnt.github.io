I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Biomedical Sciences at the University of Padova. I currently work on the brain criticality hypothesis. For more information on my current projects visit the Research tab !  

### A little bit background of mine 

I have a BSc and MSc in Physics Engineering from Istanbul Technical University. I got my PhD in the Computational Sciences and Engineering Program at Kadir Has University, Istanbul, working on data-driven network reconstruction. My research focuses on complex systems through the lens of statistical physics. In addition to biological systems, I have a broad interest in social systems, mainly phase transitions and criticality phenomena in social networks.

I like drawing characters from my favourite movies and series. I have a personal blog in Turkish which I write mostly on daily life - politics and feminism. Also, I write movie critics on a cinema blog. I am passionate about Istanbul.
